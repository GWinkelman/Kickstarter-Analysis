## Analysis of Data and Suggestions

From the 'Subcategory Statistics' sheet, you can see that a large majority of plays (238/314 or 76%) are successful at reaching their fundraiser goal. This category shows a lot of potential for successfully funding a campaign in this category. This is further supported by the images named 'USTheaterSuccessRate' and 'Plays Statistics' listed below. 
  
As referenced in the 'OutcomesBasedOnLaunch' image below, it appears that the months of May and June would be the best time to run a campaign. These months have the highest number of successful campaigns and they have the highest ratios of successful:failed campaigns (both are over 2:1). 

As seen in the 'GBFundraisingGoalvPledged' image below, the gap between the campaign goals and actual amounts pledged for musicals in Great Britain drops off quite a bit. From this box plot, we can see that mean of campaign goals is around $4000, but the mean of the amount pledged is only around $1000. This plot also shows that over 25% of campaigns don't get any funding at all. To elaborate, since the orange plot is touching the x-axis, there are at least 25% of campaigns that did not receive funding. Based on this plot, we can see that a low-budget campaign with a smaller goal is much more likely to be supported by backers and become successful. A maximum goal should be about $2000 for this category of campaign, as it is not much higher than the mean amount that is pledged for these musicals.  Set realistic expectations and understand that a very large majority of musical campaigns do not exceed more than $1500 pleged.  

All in all, the data shows that a successful musical Kickstarter campaign should have a goal of around $1500-$2000, would be best implemented in the months of May and June, and has a lot of potential compared to most other Kickstarter categories.
