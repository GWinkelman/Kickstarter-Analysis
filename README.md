# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project contains data from thousands of Kickstarter fundraising campaigns in multiple countries.  The data was filtered and analyzed to help determine the best times, goals, and expectations to starting a Kickstarter campaign. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to further look into the Theater category of the Kickstarter data and determine the best time to launch a theater campaign for a play based on when the campaigns were launched and what the outcomes were based on the goal amount of the campaign.  A client wants to start a play campaign, so this data was filtered to match that category to show what plays and other theater productions were successful and when they were started.  

## Analysis and Challenges
This file contains the dataset that was analyzed in order to better understand how a successful Kickstarter campaign is run, [Kickstarter_Challenge_copy](path/to/Kickstarter_Challenge_copy.xlxs).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data was filtered to show the Theater outcomes based on the month that the Kickstarter projects were launched. All years were counted in this analysis, which included a total of 1369 Theater projects to analyze. It appears that the outcome correlates with the launch date for theater projects.  As seen in this image, ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png), there are spikes in the data that show May and June have a high volume of successful campaigns launched.  This is visualized by the orange line on top (“successful”) increasing and then staying well above the yellow line (“failed”).  As seen in the pivot table on the sheet ‘Theater Outcomes by Launch Date’, the months of May and June both have over a 2:1 ratio of successful:failed campaigns. This chart also shows that the later months in the year (October-December) weren’t quite as successful.  This can be seen with the orange line (“successful”) declining, while the yellow line (“failed”) had some spiking increases.  Lastly, the analysis of this data shows that out of 1369 campaigns, only 37 of them were canceled for theater specifically.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes of plays were further analyzed to determine what fundraising goals produced the most successful and failed outcomes. The ranges of the goals can be seen in this image from the excel document, ![Goal_Categories](path/to/Goal_Categories.png).  After analyzing plays in each goal range, the percentages of each range was calculated for the percent successful, failed, and canceled.  The following image is the line chart created from this data, ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](path/to/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).  As seen in the chart, the blue line (“percentage successful”) is above the orange line (“percentage failed”) from the ranges of 0-14999 dollars.  The other range that shows more successful plays versus failed is at the 35000-45000 range.  All other goal ranges show the orange line on top, signifying that those goal ranges tend to fail more than they are successful.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges and difficulties encountered include formatting the graphs correctly, paying attention to what the data is saying, and filtering the correct data.  I had some trouble figuring out the line charts, as I could not get the values that I wanted to be represented on the correct axes.  Once the graphs were fixed, it was easy to comprehend and summarize.  Paying attention to the data is very important, especially in this situation.  In the ‘Outcomes Based on Goal worksheet’, [Kickstarter_Challenge_copy](path/to/Kickstarter_Challenge_copy.xlxs), 889 of the 1047 total projects had goals less than 9999 dollars. There aren’t many projects with larger goals, making the data less predictable and reliable.  Lastly, I had some trouble filtering the correct data but I did some troubleshooting and realized my function was missing a component. Then the analysis worked and provided me with clear results.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion that can be made is May and June are the best times to launch a campaign for theater projects.  Both of these months have over a 2:1 ratio of successful:failed campaigns, and they are the only months with this high of a ratio.  Another conclusion is that launching a campaign in the months of October-December is very risky, since there are a lot less successful campaigns.  The ratio for October-December of successful:failed campaigns is about 1.3, which is much lower than the summer months (around 2). 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The outcomes seem to be very reliant on the goal amount of money needed for a successful campaign.  When the goal is less than 15000 dollars, plays tend to succeed much more than they fail.  The ratio of successful:failed plays in this range is 2.2. In general, once the goal exceeds 15000, plays tend to fail far more often than they succeed. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dataset include outliers and limited data in some areas and also generalized information/data. In the ‘Outcomes Based on Goal’ worksheet of this dataset, you can see that there are only 86 total play projects for all goals above 15000 dollars.  This doesn’t give us much data for the higher goal ranges, which makes it less reliable and predictable.  In the limited data that we have though, it shows that plays tend to fail once the goal exceeds that 15000 dollar amount.  Another limitation is the generalized information.  There is a lot of data about where these theater productions occurred, but they are only sorted by country. In the US for instance, there are very large cost-of-living differences based on where a campaign is started.  For instance, someone in New York might need 15000 to run a successful play where that play could possibly be run in a lower-cost area such as Wisconsin for much less. Geographic location and current events in a country are just two of the other variables that should be considered when looking over this data if you are the one that is going to attempt to run a successful theater campaign.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other tables and graphs that we could create would be individual pie charts for each month of the Outcomes Based on Launch Date analysis.  These would highlight the months with the largest ratio between successful and failed campaigns, and the May and June months would make up about 2/3 of the chart.  Pie charts could also be used for each goal range since the data was collected as a percentage out of 100. These would also help visualize the ratio between successful and failed campaigns for plays.  Besides the pie charts, a box and whisker plot could be used to show the differences between the goal and the actual amount pledged for the plays.  This would help better understand how far below the goal each failed project was, and can also help plan for a more realistic goal based on the data of the other plays.
